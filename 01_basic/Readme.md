# 01. Basic --- [[Back]](https://github.com/Wilhelmine21/LearningPerl#perl)
## Some suggestions from ChatGPT
* Perl is a high-level, interpreted language used for scripting and data manipulation. It's often used for web development, text processing, and system administration.
### Here are the basics of Perl programming:
#### Variables: 
* In Perl, you can declare a variable with the "$" symbol. For example, to declare a variable named "myVariable" with a value of 10, you would write "$myVariable = 10;".

#### Data Types: 
* Perl has several data types, including scalars (which store a single value), arrays (which store multiple values), and hashes (which store key-value pairs).

#### Control structures: 
* Perl has various control structures, including if-else statements, loops (for, while, until), and more.

#### Operators: 
* Perl has various operators, including arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), comparison operators (==, !=, >, <), and more.

#### Subroutines: 
* In Perl, you can define your own subroutines to encapsulate a block of code. You can then call these subroutines later in your code.

#### Regular Expressions: 
* Perl has a rich set of features for working with regular expressions, which are patterns used to match and manipulate strings.

* This is just a brief overview of the basics of Perl programming. There is much more to learn, but these basics should give you a good starting point.
## 01-1 Scalar
* Example:
    ```perl
    $str1="ABC";
    print "Hi, $str1\n";
    
    $num1 = 10;
    $num2 = 20;
    $sum12 = $num1 + $num2;
    print " $num1 + $num2 = $sum12\n";
    ```
